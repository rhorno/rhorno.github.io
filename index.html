            My name is Richard, and I am originally from Stockholm, Sweden. As a
            former elite athlete in team sports and a senior software engineer,
            I have acquired strong skills in web development, specifically in
            frontend development. My passion for creating and working with
            computers has always been a significant aspect of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my professional career, I have cultivated a keen interest
            in business, acquiring an understanding of prioritization and a
            knack for seeing the big picture. I firmly believe in making
            decisive, iterative, and data-driven decisions to achieve progress
            and discern what the user wants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collaboration, and learning from others who possess differing
            perspectives and experiences, are some of the aspects of teamwork
            that I cherish. My track record includes mentoring while looking
            forward to being a future leader. My personality is helpful,
            unpretentious, and easy-going.
